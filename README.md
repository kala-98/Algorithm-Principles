## Algorithms

### Binary Search
- Getting the result by dividing a dataset in 2 equal portions each time. It is more efficient than simple search and the worst case scenario can be calculated throw $log{_2}{n}={x}$ where n is the number of elements in the sorted list, while x represents the maximum's attempts
